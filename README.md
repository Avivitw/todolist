# Smart To-Do


*Smart To-Do is a simple, single-page application that categorizes the user input automatically.*
*The application provides 4 lists: read, write, eat and buy. Currently, only mobile phone display is supported.*

This is a shared project that I did with Wade Croft as part of my learning at Lighthouse Labs.

This project is not finished as we had a tight timeline for creating a demo.
